# Deep Learning architectures for Computer Vision

This repository contains various Deep Learning models and utility functions implemented from scratch for different Computer Vision tasks using **Keras 3** and **TensorFlow**.

## Install requirements
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Available Models

Currently, the following models are included in this repository:

- **ViT** (Vision Transformer)
- **U-Net** (U-Net for image segmentation)
- **FOMO** (Fewer Objects, More Objects)
- **EfficientNet** (The well known EfficientNet backbone)
- **ResNet** (Residual Networks)
